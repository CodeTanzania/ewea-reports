# Convention

## Aggregations

- Each aggregation should be named after a `model` it derived from except for specialized aggegations
- Each aggregation should expose it base
- Each base aggregation should support initial criteria
- All aggregations are runned against data seeds available in `test/fixtures`

## Fields

- All extra metric fields should be added into `metrics` object to avoid collision with other aggregation fields
- All extra time fields should be in their singular form e.g `active`
- All extra time fields should be suffixed with `Time` e.g `activeTime`
